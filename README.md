# HR-data-analytics

"""
This is a Streamlit web application that performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the HR dataset using the pandas-profiling library.

The app loads the HR-Employee-Attrition.csv file and generates a pandas profiling report that provides a comprehensive overview of the dataset, including summary statistics, data types, missing values, correlations, and more.

The app is built using Streamlit, a Python library for building interactive web applications, and ydata-profiling, a library for generating data profiles.
